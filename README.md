Transformation + Normalization + PCA (T+N+PCA) with c=5 has the best overall performance:

Silhouette Score: 0.8063 (highest among all methods and cluster counts), indicating well-defined clusters.
Calinski-Harabasz Index: 3503 (significantly higher than other methods), suggesting clear separability of clusters.
Davis-Bouldin Index: 0.2748 (lowest, indicating the least similarity between clusters), suggesting well-separated clusters.
Transformation + Normalization + PCA (T+N+PCA) with c=4 is also a strong performer:

Silhouette Score: 0.7544 (second highest).
Calinski-Harabasz Index: 1467 (second highest).
Davis-Bouldin Index: 0.3868 (second lowest).
No Preprocessing with c=6 has decent performance compared to other unprocessed methods:

Silhouette Score: 0.327 (highest among no preprocessing methods).
Calinski-Harabasz Index: 651.
Davis-Bouldin Index: 0.949.
Normalization-only methods generally perform poorly:

Very low Silhouette Scores (close to 0 or negative), suggesting poorly defined clusters.
Low Calinski-Harabasz Index values.
High Davis-Bouldin Index, indicating less cluster separation.
Final Recommendation:
The best clustering configuration for this dataset is achieved with Transformation + Normalization + PCA and using 5 clusters (c=5).
